I need to:
	- Stylize.
	- Organize in different files.
	- Javascript.
	- <input type="text"> a lot of stuff

	- simplify tags:
		- large row: AC, initiative, speed
		- small row: exp, inspiration, size
		- button row: level up, short rest, long rest

		- all stat description (experience, initiative, AC): bottom of the large div
		- make (almost) everything the same div class
